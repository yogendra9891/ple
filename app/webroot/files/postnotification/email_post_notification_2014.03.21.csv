<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.<img alt="""" src=""http://14.141.28.114:2225/ple_vers7/img/ckeditor/download_(1).jpg"" style=""height:222px; width:227px"" /></p>

<p>&quot;But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?&quot;</p>

<p>However, this vector is at an angle&nbsp;<strong><em>&theta;</em>&nbsp;</strong>to the&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;axis. Thus the component of the field produced by&nbsp;<strong><em>dl</em>&nbsp;</strong>in the&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;-axis is given by:</p>

<p>Thus we have a set of equations for the field of a ring.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Field of a Solenoid</p>

<p>In many instances a wire is coiled in a helical pattern to create a cylindrically shaped object known as a solenoid. These objects are frequently used in magnetic experiments, as they create an almost uniform field inside the cylinder. The solenoid can be seen as the superposition of a large number of rings, one on top of the other. Shown below is a typical solenoid, with its field lines:</p>

<p>Figure %: A solenoid, shown with some field lines</p>

<p>The field has a similar shape as a ring, but appears more &quot;stretched&quot;, a result of the cylindrical shape of the object.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can use the same method to find the magnitude of the magnetic field on the axis of the solenoid that we did with the ring. However, the calculus is long and complicated and, since we have already gone through the process, we will simply state the equations.</p>

<p>Consider a solenoid with&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;turns per centimeter, carrying a current&nbsp;<strong><em>I</em>&nbsp;</strong>, shown below.</p>

<p>Application of the Magnetic Field Equation</p>

<p>This equation is quite complicated, and is difficult to understand on a theoretical level. Thus, to show its applicability, we will use the equation to calculate something we already know: the field from a straight wire. We begin by drawing a diagram showing a straight wire, including an element&nbsp;<strong><em>dl</em>&nbsp;</strong>, in relation to a point a distance&nbsp;<strong><em>x</em>&nbsp;</strong>from the wire:</p>

<p>Figure %: An element dl on a long wire, contributing to the magnetic field at&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;, a distance&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;from the wire</p>

<p>From the figure, we see that the distance between&nbsp;<em>dl</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<img src=""http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/2/288a4611d51a3a7ce874c4a906855ac9/latex_img34.gif"" />&nbsp;. In addition, the angle between&nbsp;<strong><img src=""http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/2/288a4611d51a3a7ce874c4a906855ac9/latex_img62.gif"" />&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><em>dl</em>&nbsp;</strong>is given by&nbsp;<strong>sin<em>&theta;</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<img src=""http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/2/288a4611d51a3a7ce874c4a906855ac9/latex_img70.gif"" />&nbsp;</strong>. Thus we have the necessary values to plug into our equation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>dB</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<img src=""http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/2/288a4611d51a3a7ce874c4a906855ac9/latex_img41.gif"" />&nbsp;=&nbsp;<img src=""http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/2/288a4611d51a3a7ce874c4a906855ac9/latex_img37.gif"" /></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we have an expression for the contribution of a small piece, we may sum over the whole wire to find the total magnetic field. We integrate our expression with respect to&nbsp;<strong><em>l</em>&nbsp;</strong>, with limits of integration from&nbsp;&infin;&nbsp;to&nbsp;- &infin;&nbsp;:</p>

Since&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong><em>x</em>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><em>c</em>&nbsp;</strong>are constants, we may remove them from the integral, simplifying the calculus. This integral is still quite complicated, and we must use a table of integration to solve it. It turns out that the integral is equal to<strong><img src=""http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/2/288a4611d51a3a7ce874c4a906855ac9/latex_img55.gif"" />&nbsp;</strong>. We evaluate this expression using our limits:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we plug infinity into our expression we find that&nbsp;<strong><img src=""http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/2/288a4611d51a3a7ce874c4a906855ac9/latex_img65.gif"" />&nbsp;<img src=""http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/2/288a4611d51a3a7ce874c4a906855ac9/latex_img66.gif"" />&nbsp;<em>l</em>&nbsp;</strong>, implying that plugging in a value of infinity yields the value&nbsp;<strong>1/<em>x</em>&nbsp;2&nbsp;</strong>. When we plug in our negative infinity, we get&nbsp;-1/<em>x</em>&nbsp;2&nbsp;in a similar manner. Thus:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the equation we saw earlier for the field of a straight wire, implying that our calculus equation derived earlier is correct. The math that accompanies this kind of calculation is difficult, and rarely used, but it is essential for deriving the formulae we will encounter in the</p>
